No ego left to flex.

I parted ways with my last church on great personal terms but failed professional ones. I have not worked nor have anything lined up. Two weeks after moving back home, someone broke into my family's house and stole my laptop. Every day I'm trying to figure out what to do for that day and the day after that and the day after that and the week after that and the month after that. 

In my heart, it's the lowest I've personally been, both spiritually and mentally. Heck, even physically. I'm an absolute mess.

I've told many a college student that this is precisely the place where God calls us to be, where the gospel becomes a little more real, makes a little more sense, where the pain might remain but the difference is hope.

Time to practice what I've preached.
