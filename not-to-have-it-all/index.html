<p>I find myself sitting in the last class of my last year of schooling. Sometimes it's high school, sometimes it's college, sometimes it's seminary. There are ten minutes left and I'm clock-watching, waiting for the ball to drop at Times Square University. Then I get the note. Sometimes it's an e-mail. Other times, it's a direct jumpcut to a scene in a school counselor's office. And I find out I'm actually a couple of credits short of graduating. That there's still more to do. That I'm not actually done yet, that I'm not home yet. That my work is still incomplete, in fact, I'm still incomplete. And then I wake up.</p><picture>

<p>The word "potential" has always been weird to me. I can't seem to make sense of whether it's a positive term or a negative one. It's great to hear growing up but does a 35 year old still want to be told they still have potential? And putting aside the torturous game of peer comparison that we all love playing, potential doesn't pay for meals at fine dining establishments, get you ordained, or even get you married. In fact, I've found potential to do a wonderful job of keeping me very, very single.</p><p>Maybe that's what makes Jesus so interesting. 30 odd years and then three intense ones of work. End it with a massive beating and a cross. Never hitting the life milestones that so much of the world and even the church emphasizes and treasures and sanctifies, the "normal Christian life". What was His potential?How many different directions could things have gone had there been a fourth year or if He just got along with others or decided to stop being so nomadic and settle down for a little and just gotten a job like everyone else?</p><p>It's not that I find Him to be a model though He surely is that for me. It's more that in Jesus I'm beginning to see why potential should not be worn like a weight vest, piled on my back like the beast of burden I see myself as. That it's a product of my own design, my sleep tormentor, that always says I'll never have done enough, be good enough, reach the heights I'm destined to reach. Because amid the thought of what more Jesus could've accomplished if He stuck around a little longer, there was no hesitation in His voice when He said, "It is finished." No thought of what else He still had to do, what He was possibly missing out on. By His death, His life could say mission accomplished. It is with this confidence I pray to sleep in every night, this hope with which I go forth every day. </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">Not to Have It All</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
