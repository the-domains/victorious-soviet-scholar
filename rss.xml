            <title><![CDATA[Not to Have It All]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Not to Have It All</h1><p>I have a recurring dream, a preoccupation that takes hold time and time again. It's a constant reflection of my greatest insecurity, the part of my soul that I hate laying bare before friends and God. Perhaps it was founded by the manner in which I was raised but it ultimately finds its roots in my own psyche for I'm the one who doesn't want to let it go. Anyway, the dream.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The In Between</h1><p>I think of the disquieting silence of every funeral I've been to.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Good Friday</h1><p>Left to my own devices, if I were to design my savior, to bring to life a person who would and could embody every utopian ideal weaved through the tapestry of my personal hopes and dreams and desires while balancing the interests of the general public, I might have someone akin to a Mother Teresa, a Buddha-type with a Confucian mind, or a superhero even Marvel comics could not imagine. What I would not end up with is Jesus nor the cross. And that is why this Friday is a Good one for grace refuses to magically spring up from within my heart or mind but instead is poured over me by the one who gave His life for me.</p></article>]]></description>
