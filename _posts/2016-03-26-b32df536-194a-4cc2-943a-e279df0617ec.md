description: 'Left to my own devices, if I were to design my savior, to bring to life a person who would and could embody every utopian ideal weaved through the tapestry of my personal hopes and dreams and desires while balancing the interests of the general public, I might have someone akin to a Mother Teresa, a Buddha-type with a Confucian mind, or a superhero even Marvel comics could not imagine. What I would not end up with is Jesus nor the cross. And that is why this Friday is a Good one for grace refuses to magically spring up from within my heart or mind but instead is poured over me by the one who gave His life for me.'

Left to my own devices, if I were to design my savior, to bring to life a person who would and could embody every utopian ideal weaved through the tapestry of my personal hopes and dreams and desires while balancing the interests of the general public, I might have someone akin to a Mother Teresa, a Buddha-type with a Confucian mind, or a superhero even Marvel comics could not imagine. What I would not end up with is Jesus nor the cross. And that is why this Friday is a Good one for grace refuses to magically spring up from within my heart or mind but instead is poured over me by the one who gave His life for me.
