I think of the disquieting silence of every funeral I've been to. I feel the lump in my throat every time I've heard the news I didn't want to hear. The air that rushes out my lungs whenever I've been broken to pieces and the slip of my feet every time the false foundations of my wayward soul have given way.

Yet fear not; trudge forth in hope. 

Sunday's coming.
